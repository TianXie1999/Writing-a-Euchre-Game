# Writing-a-Euchre-Game

Writing an AI playing a card game named Euchre

Euchre (pronounced “YOO-kur”) is a trick-taking card game popular in Michigan. It is most commonly played by four people in two partnerships with a deck of 24 cards. Partnerships accumulate points for winning tricks, and the game continues until one side reaches the maximum number of points.

In this project, you will write a simulator for a game of Euchre. You will gain experience with abstract data types, object-oriented programming, and polymorphism. While building the simulator, you will use classes, std::array, std::vector, and C++ style strings.

This project is designed by Andrew DeOrio, but it has lots of freedom. Here is my implementation of Euchre!
